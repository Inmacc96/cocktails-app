## :rocket: Introduction
The main goal of the app is to provide a pleasant and convenient web user experience for those who are looking for cocktail recipes or simply want to have a list of their favourite drinks at hand. With this application, users will be able to access detailed information about each cocktail, including images, instructions and list of ingredients. In addition, they will be able to save their favourite cocktails in a personalised list for easy access at any time.
